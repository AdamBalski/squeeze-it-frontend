## squeeze-it-frontend

### If you want to run docker build on the Dockerfile you have to change frontend variable to `http://localhost` in 'src/consts/consts.js' then run `npm run build` and you can build it so it will work with backend (you have to also prepare a backend a little bit).

### Project setup

npm install
```

#### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

#### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

#### Lints and fixes files

npm run lint
```

#### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
